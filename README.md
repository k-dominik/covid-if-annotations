# covid-if-annotation-tool

Annotation Tool for immunofluorescence assay images

----------------------------------

## Getting Started

### The  aim of this software

It allows you to manually annotate 2D images of cells, starting from an exisitng and partially wrong cell segmentation. Two kinds of annotations are supported: 1) correcting the provided segmentation and 2) assigning one of the predefined labels to segmented cells. **We would greatly appreciate labels of both kinds!**

You can find a [short video demonstrating the tools functionality here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwpRrX_PDFo&feature=youtu.be).

### Contact us

If you have feedback or run into issues join the "COVID-IF-annotations" channel on [https://chat.embl.org](https://chat.embl.org/) or contact us directly.

## Step-by-step guide

### Download and install the software

You can download the software here:

- [Windows](https://files.ilastik.org/covid-if-annotations-setup-latest.exe).
- [Mac](https://files.ilastik.org/covid-if-annotations_0.0.2dev7.app.tar.bz2)

Installation:

- MacOS: download the file, double-click to extract the .app file from the archive. Right-click the .app file and select "Open" from the menu. It will ask if you are sure, since you have downloaded this file from here and not from the app store. Press the "Open" button and the tool main window should appear.
- Windows: TBA

### Download an image to annotate

To obtain an image for annotation
- Visit [https://annotate.embl.de/](https://annotate.embl.de/) (only available from within the EMBL network, use VPN if you are not on campus)
- `Register` and `Login`
- Go to `Download` and press `Download Image` to get a new image

### Open the input image

Drag-and-drop the .h5 file you downloaded into the tool or use the File->Open menu item. After you do this, you should see an image like this:

 <img src="./img/file_opened.png" alt="Start-up window" style="width: 70vw; min-width: 330px;"> 

The multi-colored overlay shows the preliminary cell segmentation we have obtained with our current pipeline. In the lower half of the left part of the window you see a list of displayed overlays, which you can turn on and off by clicking on the eye icon or configure using the controls in the upper left. 
The white dots in the middle of each cell show the label assigned to it. In the beginning, all cells are white, i.e. Unlabeled. If you start from an existing project, you will also see red("infected"), cyan("control") and yellow("uncertain") labels.

### Label cells

To understand whether a cell is infected you will need to look at the channel showing the virus marker. We saved it as a separate overlay, here is what you should see if you make it visible and turn off the rest:

 <img src="./img/virus.png" alt="Virus channel" style="width: 70vw; min-width: 330px;"> 

Zoom in closer by scrolling and start inspecting indvidual cells. Turn off the segmentation overlay and turn on the cell outlines to see what's happening inside cells. Here is what it looks like:

<img src="./img/outlines.png" alt="Cell Outlines" style="width: 70vw; min-width: 330px;"> 

The red  channel in the raw data corresponds to the virus-marker overlay, but we chose to also show it separately because it's so important for the infected/control decisions. 

Now, **get ready for labeling**: make the infected-vs-control overlay visible and active (click on the eye and also somewhere else on the rectangle with the "infected-vs-control" words. You should now see this layer high-lighted. Go to the topmost 4 buttons and activate the "mouse" one as shown here:

<img src="./img/mouse_active.png" alt="Mouse" style="width: 70vw; min-width: 330px;"> 

That's it, you can now click on the white circles to give them labels! If you click and nothing happens, make sure the mouse is activated as shown above! To get the next color in the list, just click again. Don't forget, the yellow label is there for the cells where you can't decide. Here are my results after a few clicks:

<img src="./img/first_labels.png" alt="First labels" style="width: 70vw; min-width: 330px;"> 

You should label cells as control that show actual signal in the virus marker channel. Note that this channel is noisy,
so if you can't tell if the signal you see is real or noise, mark the cell as uncertain.
TODO maybe Severina or Vibor should expand on this

### Correct cell segmentations
The segmentations you see here were produced by our current pipeline. They are automatic and thus not perfect. Here is what you do if you notice a segmentation error:

1. make the cell-segmentatioon overlay active by clicking on it. You should now see a different row of controls on the very top. 
<img src="./img/segmentation_1.png" alt="Segmentation" style="width: 70vw; min-width: 330px;"> 

Now the pipette is for the color picker, the drop for filling and the pen for drawing. 

2. locate the cell you want to correct and select its color with the color picker. In the example below, I will make the dark gray cell larger. Note, how the "label" field in the upper left configuration pane now shows the label I selected, by color and by numeric id.
<img src="./img/segmentation_2.png" alt="Segmentation" style="width: 70vw; min-width: 330px;"> 

3. select the pen tool and paint on top of other cells to re-assign their pixels to the cell whose color you picked. I painted and my cell got better (what do I know, I'm not a cell biologist. At least it's now different).

<img src="./img/segmentation_3.png" alt="Segmentation" style="width: 70vw; min-width: 330px;"> 
4. To see the changes you have made to the segmentation in the "infected-vs-control" and "cell-outlines", press "u".
5. Now what if you want to paint a new cell that we missed? Press "n" on your keyboard to activate a new, unused label. Then paint your  new cell. Done!

Keep going until you have all the cells labeled and all segmentation errors fixed.
**Don't forget to save your results frequently by pressing "shift + s"!**
The results will be saved to a file called `"IMAGE_NAME_annotations.h5" in the same folder where you store the image.`

In order to see your progress and find the cells you still need to label, you can press "h" to hide the boundaries in "cell-outlines" for the cells which you have annotated already.

If you get really tired or bored and can't do the whole image, send us the partial result, that would already be very helpful! You can also take a break and [load the saved annotations](https://github.com/hci-unihd/covid-if-annotations#reload-saved-results) again to continue later.

### Reload saved results

In order to continue labeling, you can reload the saved annotations:
- Open the tool again and open the original image file.
- Next, drag'n'drop the annotation results onto the viewer.
- This will replace the initial segmentation with your corrections and also load the cell labels.

### Upload your results

- Go to [https://annotate.embl.de/](https://annotate.embl.de/)
- Log in with your account
- Go to `Upload`
- Click `Browse...` and select your annotation result.
- Press `Upload Images`




## For Developers

### Install from source

Set up a conda environment with all dependencies and activate it:

```
conda create -c conda-forge -n test-annotations napari scikit-image h5py pandas
conda activate test-annotations
```
Then install this tool using pip:
```
pip install -e .
```

After installing the plugin, you can run
```
python launch.py
```
to launch the annotation tool. Drag and drop data to annotate onto the viewer.
Or you can start the tool with data already via:
```
python launch.py --path /path/to/data.h5
```

Example data is [available here](https://oc.embl.de/index.php/s/IghxebboVxgpraU).

## Keybindings:
- `u` update point and edge layer from the segmentation corrections and semantic annotations.
- `h` toggle visibility of already annotated segments.
- `n` get next label
- `Shift + s` save the current annotations (segmentation + infected-vs-control labels)
