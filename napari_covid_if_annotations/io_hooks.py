"""
This module is an example of a barebones numpy reader plugin for napari.

It implements the ``napari_get_reader`` hook specification, (to create
a reader plugin) but your plugin may choose to implement any of the hook
specifications offered by napari.
see: https://napari.org/docs/plugins/hook_specifications.html

Replace code below accordingly.  For complete documentation see:
